Some of the APIs were introduced in recent versions. We recommend using version 5.6 or upper.

You can launch these commands using any rest client. To benefit of the best syntax highlighting and auto-completion we recommend using Kibana's development tools console :

 - Download and install Kibana (Go to [https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana) and follow the Installation Steps)
 - Go to [https://localhost:5601/app/kibana#/dev_tools/console](https://localhost:5601/app/kibana#/dev_tools/console) (replace `localhost:5601` by the appropriate location according to your configuration)
